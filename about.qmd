##About John

-   Hi, I’m JT, I am a developer that lives in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

-   👀 I’m interested in Shiny apps, statistics, AI-ML, and cyber resiliency.

-   🌱 I’m always learning more R, Python and SQL.

-   💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Shiny apps for enterprise, dashboards for strategic insights, statistical analysis and data cleaning.

-   📫 How to reach me: [millerauthor\@datascientistdude.com](mailto:millerauthor@datascientistdude.com) for business inquiries please.

-   😄 Dad Joke of the Day: How do you throw a party in outer space? You plan-et!

-   ⚡ Fun fact: I am a (former) Russian/Ukrainian linguist and they are not my first languages.
