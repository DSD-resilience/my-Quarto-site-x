title: "The Iris Dataset"
---

This is my exploratory data analysis of the iris data set.

You can learn more about the iris data set by visiting [here](https://gist.github.com/curran/a08a1080b88344b0c8a7 "A GitHub repository."){.uri}.

Often I will start with a simple `summary` function to get a feel for the data set:

```{r simple-code}
summary(iris)
```

Here we can see that there are five features (columns). The "big five" statistics are featured: minimum value, 1st quartile value, median value, mean value, 3rd quartile value, maximum value.

This is helpful, but how many observations (rows) and features (columns) do we have?

```{r row-numbers}
dim(iris)
```

What is the mean petal length for all species of iris?

```{R mean-petal-length}
mean_petal_length <- mean(iris$Petal.Length)
mean_petal_length
```

What is the mean sepal length for all species of iris?

`mean_sepal_length <- mean(iris$Sepal.Length)`
