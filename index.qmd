title: "The Iris Dataset"
---

This is my experimental Quarto website.

I learned about Quarto websites by visiting <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

This is simple R code that I have embedded in the website:

```{r simple-code}
summary(iris)

```

I want to work up to being able to embed Shiny apps in order to test them.
