title: "The Iris Dataset"
---

This is my exploratory data analysis of the iris dataset.

You can learn more about the iris data set by visiting [here](https://gist.github.com/curran/a08a1080b88344b0c8a7 "A GitHub repository."){.uri}.

Often I will start with a simple `summary` function to get a feel for the data set:

```{r simple-code}
summary(iris)

```

Here we can see that there are 150 observations (rows) and several features (columns).
